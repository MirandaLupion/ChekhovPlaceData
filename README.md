# The Geography of Chekhov's Plays 
This repository contains dataset of the places, real and fictional, and their attributes mentioned in Anton Chekhov's four major plays. The file is available for download in CSV form. 

## Data Structure 
For each of the plays, data was collected on all places mentioned - both real and fictional. Places mentioned more than once in a given act were recorded once, with new plot, character, and quote information added to the existing entry. For places mentioned in multiple acts, an entry for each act was made. For example, in the data for Three Sisters, there are four entries for "Moscow" (one for each of the four acts), and all 18 mentions of "Moscow" in Act I are recorded in a single entry.
